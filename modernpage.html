            <h2 class="fade-up">Rizal’s Era Activism vs. Modern Activism</h2>

            <p class="fade-up-delay-1">
                Activism during Rizal’s time relied on writing, education, and peaceful reform led by educated elites, all 
                under the constant threat of censorship and persecution. Modern Philippine activism, seen in university and 
                religious group rallies, now operates in a democratic setting through mass demonstrations and social media to 
                demand accountability and good governance. Both fight social injustice, but modern movements are broader and 
                faster-paced, while Rizal’s was more intellectual and reform-focused.

                Both periods struggle against social injustice. Modern activism, however, is more open, fast-paced,
                issue-driven, and inclusive, while Rizal’s activism was primarily intellectual and reform-focused. Yet their
                shared goal remains: fighting for truth, justice, and a better nation.
