                        <p>
                            Working on this project was a learning experience on the legacy of Rizal and the love of the Filipinos for our country. 
                            It was fun to work on this project with the help of my peers, as we all worked together to make an educational website

                        <h3>Insights</h3>
                        <p>
                            I see that action is important in order to achieve reformation, as Rizal did to reform the Philippines in the Spanish 
                            colonial era, and what our current generation is doing to reform the existing corruption in the Philippines

                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>
                            I’ve always looked at this multimedia project as an opportunity to take what I’ve learned in this course and to contextualize 
                            it in the modern Philippine setting. Working on the content side was an insightful experience as I was able to read through 
                            different articles, blogs, and memoirs of key events that shaped the current political state of society. 
                        </p>
                        <h3>Insights</h3>
                        <p>
                            I only really realized now how persistent social issues such as inequality, injustice, and corruption are. From Rizal’s time to today, 
                            social cancer is still an incurable sickness. The mass movements that occurred this year gave me so much hope for our generation. 
                            However, reading about the two EDSA revolutions, although inspiring, somehow took all that hope away. It begged the question: 
                            “We’ve freed ourselves before, why are we back here again?” Nevertheless, I also learned from the past movements that power 
                            lies within the people, which made me realize that giving up would make me part of the problem that we are all facing. To be 
                            Rizal-like is to continue pushing for the betterment of society, which I believe should be the goal of every Filipino.

                        <p>
                            With this project, our group collaborated closely to research, organize, and present information about Rizal and modern 
                            civic action. We divided responsibilities fairly and communicated regularly to ensure the website content was consistent 
                            and clear. The main challenge was finding credible and trustworthy sources, which pushed us to cross-check facts and critically 
                            evaluate materials. Overall, the experience strengthened our teamwork and gave us valuable insights into both historical and 
                            modern activism.

                        <h3>Insights</h3>
                        <p>
                            Studying José Rizal alongside modern protest movements helped us see how civic action evolves but remains essential over time. 
                            Rizal’s work showed that activism can take many forms, from writing and education to peaceful advocacy grounded in moral courage. 
                            Modern movements continue to reflect these same values of justice, awareness, and speaking out. This project highlighted that 
                            activism remains relevant today and that citizens play a vital role in shaping society.

                        <p>
                            Working on this project gave me a space to really immerse myself in the life and writings of Rizal in a way I never had before. 
                            While helping to research and build our website’s narrative, I found myself tracing the lines from his critiques of Spanish rule 
                            to the conversations we have about our country today. Collaborating with the group made the process feel alive; it wasn’t just an 
                            assignment, but a shared effort to piece together a story that still matters.

                        <h3>Insights</h3>
                        <p>
                            What struck me most was realizing how Rizal’s idea of a “social cancer” wasn’t just a metaphor for his time, but a diagnosis that 
                            still applies. We see it in the systemic issues that persist, the gaps between rich and poor, the search for true justice, and the 
                            deep weariness people feel toward corruption. Reading about the revolutions and uprisings in our history was both inspiring and 
                            sobering; it showed me that freedom is never finally won, but constantly defended and renewed. This project reaffirmed for me that 
                            our role isn’t just to look back and admire, but to look around and ask what we can do now. If Rizal taught us anything, it’s that 
                            love for country isn’t a feeling you keep to yourself—it’s something you choose to act on, however you can.

                        <p>
                            My experience working on this project was a very educational one, given the research I needed to do on Rizal and Philippine history.
                             At the same time, as a computer science student I was ablw to apply what I was leaening in my technical courses to something that will better the country, 
                             even if only by a small margin. I'm proud of what I built and I look forward to using my knowledge for the country's benefit in the future.

                            Silence is the only thing that enables evil to do what it wants. The protests showed that together, 
                            the voices of struggling and wronged Filipinos can change the course of history, such as during Edsa 1. 
                            I also realized that anyone who truly comprehends what was done to the Philippines in the past cannot just stay silent in 
                            today's time as the very same corruption and repression of the Filipino people is happening again through incapable public servants. 
                            I widh to eee the same reform in the oast applied to the current generation similar to what Rizal wanted.
